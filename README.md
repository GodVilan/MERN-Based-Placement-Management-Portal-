  # MERN Based Placement Management Portal
  
  The MERN Based Placement Management Portal is a web-based Placement Management System developed using the MERN Stack, designed to streamline and simplify the placement process for educational institutions. This indispensable tool enables the placement cell, students, and administrators by providing a centralized platform for efficient communication and data management.
  
  With the MERN Based Placement Management Portal, students can easily access and maintain their interestâ€™s details, eliminating the need for manual paperwork and saving valuable time. Through the application, students can select companies based on their individual interests, skills, and qualifications. Along with these the student can submit their certifications. And the interesting fact about our Portal is it consists of DSA Tracker where the students can solve problems, and check their progress.
  
  The system leverages the power of the MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js) to ensure a robust and scalable solution. MongoDB serves as the database for storing student information, preferences, certifications and problems, while Express.js and Node.js handle the backend logic. React, on the other hand, takes care of the frontend, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
